# The Fantastic Garden
C++ directX9 Simple 2d top down shooting game.
Great for studying.
Very simple to build, but:
1) used fmod sound library (It api requires registration on fmod.org)
2) Korean language in the names of source code files.

Changes from forked original:
1) Deleted temporary project files (*.sdf + degug/release)
2) changed soundManager.cpp (playSound)

in progress:
1) delete link to  unused *.rc file in project
2) fmodex.dll unused - used fmod.dll (fmod_vc.lib)
3) i will translate korean text and images to english.
