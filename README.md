# The Fantastic Garden
C++ directX9 Simple 2d top down shooting game.
Great for studying.
Very simple to build, but:
1) used fmod sound library (It api requires registration on fmod.org)
2) Korean language in the names of source code files.
Changes from forked original:
1) Delete temporary project files (*.sdf + degug/release)
2) changed soundManager.cpp (playSound)
3) deleted  unused *.rc file
